                      AIME grew to 6686 mentees, 2255 mentors, 340 partner schools and 18 university
                      partners.

                      The 3-year Partnership Project was finalised and the results showed that AIME
                      can produce good and relevant numbers that can assist policy and practice to
                      drive towards better and brighter futures for our Aboriginal and Torres Strait
                      Islander students. We found that AIME positively impacts mentees:

                      The AIME program creates relationships and a culturally safe spaces that
                      support mentees’ engagement in the program;

                    <li>
                      AIME is effective in increasing mentees’ academic self-perceptions and
                      motivation;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      An increased amount of time spent within the AIME program significantly
                      increased the mentees’ sense of self-esteem, school confidence and cultural
                      confidence at school;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Mentees value not only how AIME promotes stronger study habits and
                      aspirations, but also helps students value themselves and their culture within
                      the learning environment;

                      The AIME Research Partnership published another academic journal article and
                      delivered another 6 conference presentations.
