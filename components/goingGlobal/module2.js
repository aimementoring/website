        Tensions were rising in Australia with some of our political leaders
        calling out &quot;African Gangs&quot; in Melbourne (check it out in the
        video below). We responded by reaching out and offering the model to
        African Australian leaders in Melbourne.

                and culture to understand the way of life in north-east Nigeria. I interacted
                with people across the state we are now operating out of. I ate the local food,
                I rode around on a tricycle and visited local sites. I felt the warmth of humans
                looking out for their neighbours and working relentlessly to improve their
                situation. The result is we co-created a program that addresses the needs of
                high school and tertiary students in north-east Nigeria while carrying the
                essence of kindness and fairness. We've built trust and are starting
                to delve deeper into the meaning of life and why we do what we do."`}

        Bem was no longer allowed to stay in Australia, so he said he wanted to
        return to Nigeria and start AIME there, which he has.
