        <h1>The Golden Ticket</h1>
        <p>
          With our goals and dreams we tend to shoot for the moon and even if we
          miss we land amongst the stars so we set our sights on offering AIME
          to any university student anywhere in the world. To get to them, we
          made a short film, COGS, with Oscar Award Winner Laurent Witz and
          M&amp;C Saatchi. The film was made to inspire 10 young people across
          the world to take on the chance to win a golden ticket to lead AIME in
          their country for 3 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ended up with 2 countries that fit the bill, South Africa and
          Uganda. Meet Shyaka Lwanyaaga Farid and Vhutali Nelwamondo,
          who won golden tickets and will now lead their countries as part of
          the next 3 year intensive global pilot.

            &quot;Setting up AIME in any institution is never easy. It requires
            passion, persistence and professionalism. One should always be
            aiming for success but also accepting of criticism. Ask questions
            and always be willing to learn. The AIME team have always supported
            me no matter what and they were always available to jump on a call
            to make my life simple. Always remember two things: 1) you are not
            on this alone and 2) when the going gets tough, remember you are
            doing this for the kids and you might be the only hope some kids
            see before them&quot;
