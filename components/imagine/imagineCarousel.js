          Jack Manning Bancroft, AIME CEO & Founder, has kicked in $10K of his own
          money to get this going. This will allow for 450 hoodies to be provided
          in-kind as part of our creator grants. We’d love to get up to $50K donated
          to give 2,500 people around the world the chance to create something unique
          and deeply powerful from these times.

          We've created 500 creator grants in the form of a hoodie. Those who want to
