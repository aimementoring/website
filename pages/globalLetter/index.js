          We’ve found a solution to ending inequality for the most disadvantaged kids.

          In our nation, those kids are the children of the first sunrise, our Indigenous young
          people. Many of us across the globe have population groups who have landed on the
          wrong side of history and experience dispossession and discrimination, which has
          manifested itself into what seems like an irreversible reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twelve years ago, a small group of university students set about reversing the reality
          for our Indigenous kids, and creating a new story, a tale of Indigenous success, of
          educational equality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twenty-five students at University of Sydney walked into a local school and offered a
          structured mentoring program. These students, they were on their way after their
          degree into the middle or upper classNamees, but in that moment they built a bridge
          between them and the kids whose future was flying towards a path of poverty and
          inequality.
        </p>
        <p>They built a bridge.</p>
      </div>

          backgroundPosition: '0% 25%',

        <p className="destroy-p">And from that moment, things started to change.</p>

      {/* <!-- Draws attention to a quote or subtance text piece --> */}
      <div className="wrap-md">
        <p>
          The kids on the other side started to follow their lead. They reversed the trends
          around school completion. At first as a group of 25, and then there was a hundred, and
          suddenly there were thousands that were dancing to a new beat of Indigenous success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, 12 years on, this program has seen over 10,000 kids be ripped out of educational
          inequality, closing a percentage gap of over 35% in participation. For Indigenous kids
          aged 18-25 - 40% transition into Employment, University or Further training.
          Non-Indigenous kids in the same age bracket transition at 75%. AIME Year 12 graduates
          transition rates for the last three years, 2014 = 75%, 2015 = 75.8%, 2016 = 76%.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a simple solution whereby mentoring, with a scientific backbone of content and
          development that sits on top of the schooling system has manifested a new climate that
          can fast-track the alleviation of disadvantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an aside, over 5,000 university students have volunteered to mentor over the last
          12 years, the biggest volunteer movement of university students in Australian history.
          We believe this generation is desperate to take on the challenges ahead of them, and
          you know, like what we’ve seen here, the best place for that to start is the
          birthplace of ideas and world changing revolutionary thinking, universities.

          On June 7, we join our friends at AIME to launch a competition across the globe to
          offer the chance for 10 young people to take the model potentially to your university
          and bring it to life in your country.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to give you the chance to be a part of an experiment that could prove that if
          university becomes a service hub where its students go back and mentor the most
          disadvantaged kids we could within 10 years rapidly close the existing inequality gaps
          across the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this interests you, AIME would love to talk to you and give you and your students
          the chance to be a part of this experience to change the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The AIME model globally is not specifically about Indigenous kids. It’s about using
          the two key economic levers of university and high school and building a bridge
          between the powerful and powerless.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, with one university at a time we create fairer communities and a rapidly more
          equal and just globe.
