            AIME. Of kids rising, of university students desperate to see the tide of inequality
            cease, of a small group of committed citizens bringing to life Margaret Mead's adage of
            changing the world.`}
          </p>
          <p>
            More than ever, I saw the heart of what we offer. Mentors for a fairer world. People

            {`Luck and the science behind our model has lead to AIME’s impact and why we've been able

            and dance with us on that night in September, I saw our future. One where we rose to the
            biggest possible challenges, with confidence in the truth behind our work - human
            kindness.`}

            2016 was a year where you challenged us – the kids, mentors and our team – to rise. And
            2017 will be the year we bring about an AIME with that same pigheadedly hopeful and
            bashful energy of 2005 and with more gusto than ever, at home and around the world.

          <article className="blog-post--article">
            <p>
              2016 was another year of transformational education and wonderful outcomes for the
              Indigenous kids participating in AIME across our nation. It was also a year of
              exploring new evolutionary pathways for the AIME model.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was also my last full year as Chair and, after eight years in the role it is
              remarkable to look back to see how far AIME has come in that time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2009 there were 500 mentors, in 2016 there were 1571. The number of university
              partners has increased from 4 to 18. The number of high schools with which AIME works
              has jumped remarkably from 30 to 340. And the in-kind support provided to AIME by so
              many willing individuals and corporations has grown from $1.2 million to $6.4 million.
              Such is the enthusiasm with which AIME has been embraced by so many around Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
              This has largely been possible because the Indigenous kids participating in AIME’s
              program have continued to seize the opportunity to embrace education as a pathway to
              success. And haven’t they done that so well. In 2016, progression rates were well
              above 90% at the end of each year of schooling: 99.9% for Year 7, 99.8% for Year 8,
              99.6% for Year 9, 96.2% for Year 10, 92.9% for Year 11 and 94.1% for Year 12. With
              these types of outcomes, anything is possible!
            </p>
            <p>Of course, thankfully, some things have remained similar since 2009.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We remain indebted to our young and vibrant staff, who have such a strong desire to
                learn and make a difference.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our mentors, those university students stepping outside their comfort zones to help
                those in need on a voluntary basis, continue to be the foot soldiers of AIME. They
                too are having their own lives transformed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our university partners are still making AIME’s work possible through their
                provision of vital financial support and infrastructure.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our high school partners continue to allow us to come alongside them to help
                Indigenous kids.
              </li>
              <li>
                And KPMG faithfully continues to provide invaluable audit and other services at no
                cost to AIME.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to
              AIME in 2016. In addition to those mentioned above, so many have donated money,
              provided facilities, offered advice, provided transport, and so much more. All of this
              is crucial and flows through for the benefit of those in the classrooms and on the
              stages of AIME.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we continue to strive to make life-changing differences to Indigenous kids, and now
              also reach beyond Australia, may I encourage you all to embolden your support for
              AIME.
            </p>
            <p>
              And I would like to wish my successor, Tom Dery, the very best as he steers the Board
              with fresh eyes and great enthusiasm.
            </p>

              success and achievements attained under Geoff Lovell’s guidance. I’m looking forward
              to seeing the scale the AIME operation extends and in so doing not only for the
              benefit of more education opportunities for Indigenous kids, but also our mentors and
              our team at AIME.

              It was another year of transformational education and wonderful outcomes for the
              Indigenous kids participating in AIME across our nation. It was also a year of
              exploring new evolutionary pathways for the AIME model. Here are some other

              KPMG once again audited AIME’s accounts. Headline is, we got enough cash in to be able
              to deliver the program to more kids than ever before. Second headline is that over $6
              Million worth of in-kind support was generated throughout 2016 - we are very proud of
              this. Click through below for the deets.
