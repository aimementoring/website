              AIME is an Imagination Factory that since 2005, has been creating pop-up
              Imagination Factories on university campuses around the world to unlock
              the internal narrative of marginalised kids, taking them from a world that
              tells them they can’t to a world that tells them they can. Kids who experience
              the Imagination Factory have gone on to achieve educational parity, rise up as
              entrepreneurs, and take on a whole new mindset that prepares them for success.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              What inspires our Imagination Factory are the mentors throughout human history,
              the philosophers, artists, inventors and designers who have moved humanity
              forward in positive ways. With the force of imagination, mentoring and unlikely
              alliances between those with power and those without, AIME is creating a fairer
              world.
