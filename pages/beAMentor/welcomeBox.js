        Welcome to the world of mentoring.
      </h4>
      <p>
        We believe a mentor can change someone’s life through a permanent shift in mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
        {`
          We want to ignite the flame within university/college students across the planet to rise up
          as mentors for marginalised youth and lead a revolution for them to rise up out of
          inequality. We've been working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander kids in Australia
          for the past 15 years and in 2019 we're working across Australia, Uganda, South Africa,
          Nigeria and the United States. Soon to be launching in Rwanda and Zimbabwe too. We
          understand that what we are fighting for is a global issue, and it takes a united effort to
          defeat systematic oppression. We are aware that these issues don’t exist just in our
          backyard, but all around the globe.
