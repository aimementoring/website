        Jack Manning Bancroft is the CEO and Founder of AIME, an
        award-winning social movement that uses mentoring and imagination
        to unlock the potential of marginalised youth to create a fairer
        world.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
        AIME is an imaginative educational program and a volunteer mentoring
        movement - a social network for good.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
        Jack, a proud Indigenous Australian from the Bundjalung nation,
        founded AIME in 2005 at the age of 19, with the goal of finding a
        solution to Indigenous inequality in Australia. Driven by
        imagination and audacious kindness, he re-engineered the concept of
        mentoring. He developed a cost-effective and scalable model that
        brings university students together as volunteers to mentor
        marginalised and minority high schools kids so that they complete
        high school successfully, go on to university and ultimately, into
        fulfilling careers.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
        Over the past 16 years, AIME’s mentoring tools and techniques - its
        Imagination Curriculum, of which Jack has been the lead designer -
        have helped transform schooling for thousands of marginalised kids.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
        Jack’s vision is to unlock the AIME Imagination Curriculum for every
        school in the world and train teachers to be mentors so we can
        achieve educational parity and beyond for marginalised kids across
        the Earth’s surface.
        </Paragraph>
