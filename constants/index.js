      <p>AIME commissioned KPMG to undertake an economic evaluation of the program with the primary purpose of assessing the value-for-money of AIME. The economic evaluation quantified the benefits relating to education (the potential total lifetime earnings of the AIME mentee population in 2012, compared to potential total
        lifetime earnings of a similarly sized group of Indigenous students around the country). Findings included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AIME mentees performed better than Indigenous students around the country and reached levels of school performance close to their non-Indigenous peers.</li>
        <li>Due to the mentoring benefits received, AIME mentees are likely to be more employable and earn more.</li>
        <li>An AIME mentee that completes a university degree can be expected to earn up to $332,000 more over their lifetime compared to an Indigenous student that does not complete high school.</li>
